# Project Overview
In many organizations, performance metrics are an important part of company culture. It is an important method used to ensure that the goals of the organization as a whole are met as well as helps to develop employees professionally. Through performance programs, it makes it easier to identify top performers and those that may need help. This project takes a look at the quality of performance goals that have been entered by one company and rates the quality of the goals based on the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable,Relevant and Time Bound) goals model.

# Description:
In this project, Airflow was used to orchestrate a workflow that did the following:
1.Create a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) that executed tasks to add CSV files to Google Cloud
    1.The DAG file begins with two functions that act as a checklist to ensure that the data files are properly placed and to ensure that the DAG is able to connect to the Big Query client
    2. A DAG is then created with it's accompanying tasks
    3. The first 2 tasks run the checklist functions, followed by an empty operator for branching the table creation tasks
    4. The next task runs a loop that loads each table
    5. Finally, another empty operator is used to bring the tasks back together 



# Setup/Installation Requirements:
- To see the code files in this project:
  1. Clone the repo in Git Hub: 
                a. Click the green "code" button
                b. Under the "Local" tab, copy and paste the URL that is under HTTPS
- Set up Airflow 
  1. In your visual studio terminal of your choice, create and activate a virtual environment in your repository folder by typing the following commands: 
     1. python3.10 -m venv <virtual environment name>
     2. source <virtual environment name>/bin/activate 
  2. Run the setup.sh file by typing ./setup.sh. This script sets up your environment and installs the necessary components
  3. Create the following new directories in the same folder:
     1. ./logs
     2. ./plugins
     3. ./dags
  4. Pull down the latest version of Airflow by typing 	"curl -LfO 'https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/docker-compose.yaml'"
  5. Create a Airflow user id by typing "echo -e "AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)\nAIRFLOW_GID=0" > .env"
  6. Start Airflow and all related containers by typing:
     1. docker-compose up airflow-init
     2. docker-compose up
  7. Leave that terminal running and then open a new terminal to continue working in
  8. In your browser, go to localhost:8080, this will take you to the Airflow Graphical User Interface
  9. In the Airflow User Interface (browser), create a file connection called "data_fs" by clicking "Admin" --> "Connections". Enter the following:
     1.  Connection ID = data_fs
     2.  Connection Type = file (path)
     3.  Path = {"path":"/data"} 
- Shutting down Airflow and docker
  1. Switch to the terminal that is running your Airflow commands
  2. Either press CTRL + C or type "docker compose down"
  3. Type "docker system prune --volumes" to remove all volumes from the docker container
  4. type "docker volume list" to confirm that there are no volumes


# Known Bugs
Due to Google Permission issues, the DAG failed in Airflow

# Project Visuals


## DAG 
The DAG Diagram in this project shows the order of tasks and their dependencies, if any.

## DAG Final Outcome
As shown in the image the DAG failed several times due to Google permission issues
