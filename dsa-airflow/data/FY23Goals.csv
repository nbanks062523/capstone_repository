Safety has always been a priority for me in my everyday life. The WIL station agents, APD and passengers are certainly confident and comfortable to bring anything regarding safety to my attention and know it will be fixed.  Even on my days off I'm open to receive calls about anything in WIL station. This year I added several signs directing passenger to the elevator to prevent falls on the steps and escalators. Signage that gave clear direction to the elevator and signage that let passengers know there are other options than dragging their luggage up and down the steps or escalator. We also had several constructions projects in WIL station this year. With that being said the were obstructions that prevented passenger form entering and exiting the platform in the usual way. Not only did I add signs to help passengers navigate the station, I also reached out to Suzanne Griffin to request for ambassadors to assist during the entire construction period. This gave passengers additional help to navigate in the station. We also used our PIDs system to make announcements about navigating throughout the station every 30 minutes.",On Track,Active

I make sure my baggage agent/ redcaps are on the platform meeting all Acela's and long hauls even if its no special service request. All station agents has the ok the leave their station to assist if needed to speed up the detraining and boarding process. I also participate in the OTP weekly calls completing my station AAR's and follow ups if requested. This year WIL has a few construction projects preventing passengers from getting to one end of the platform. To assist with this and keep train delays the a minimum the ushers are making announcements advising passengers where the stand on the platform prior the train coming in. In addition the baggage, myself or ambassadors advising pax to keep walking to the far end of the platform to board the trains.

Keeping our customers safe and happy are my top priorities. Greeting customers as they come in the station and approach our windows. Making sure the redcaps are on platform ready to assist if needed at the last minute. Having wheelchair and luggage carts readily accessible when pax need them.  Keeping our station clean with a daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly check list for station cleaners. This includes picking up and taking out the trash, cleaning restrooms, washing mirrors and glass, sweeping, mopping, dusting, floor honing, polishing, vacuuming just name a few. I also reaching out to B&B supervisor weekly for all maintenance issues (doors, seats, electric, leaks, air/ heat issues) in a timely fashion.  Keeping tracks clear of debris and platforms cleaned via power washed.  Monthly scheduled window cleaning in station, on platforms and high  windows  with Clean and Polish. 

I'm always at forefront of service disruptions and passenger issues. I respond to customer concerns and complaints in a timely fashion. I challenge my team to create a passenger 1st environment where we prioritize the passengers. I lead by example, I coach, teach and train my teams to address any passenger issues or concerns prior to it reaching customer relations. I also complement and thank positive customer relations inquiries and post them on the wall for employee acknowledgment. 

In fact, in March there was a schedule change and over 20 pax missed our 1st train due to it not showing properly on PIDS or on the Amtrak app. I sent the list of passengers that missed the train to customer relations requesting for refund and voucher for future travel.  The next day I came to work 5am to make sure the same thing did not happen. Although PIDS and Amtrak app showed the train delayed again it arrived on time. I was there to make sure all pax was on the platform ready to board on time. After learning it happened again I reached out to CTEC and Heather from OTP and learned it was signal issue and other stations such as PHL had the same issue on both days as well.

I have empowered all station staff; cleaning, baggage, customer service, tickets, and even TUCS, to be vigilant and aware of their surroundings. and to alert management and or APD to any suspicious activities or individuals that they have observed. I encourage this at every team huddle in order to build a culture of safety and involvement by all station staff. I also instruct station staff to never engage anyone and to let management and or APD handle any situation or potential conflict. Lastly, I have instructed station staff in Conflict DeEscalation and how to utilize these tools if they find themselves in a conflict situation.
 
	I have placed wet floor signs within the station at strategic locations to better address any spills that can and will occur throughout the station. I have empowered the station staff to place these signs down to ensure customer and station staff safety before calling for management or TUCS for a clean up. I periodically replace missing signs to ensure the count at each location remains constant.

 	I make sure ushers close their rear gates after they have completed their detraining and boarding. This is to ensure no unauthorized access to the platform level from the rear gate by passengers or anyone looking to commit illicit activates. If an usher has to be repeatedly reminded to do so, that agent is given a verbal coaching and it will be documented in TDRS. Also, I have attempted to make sure ushers remain at their prospective gate to monitor the detraining and boarding process incase a passenger has an incident while on the escalator and to spot anyone requiring an elevator ride.

	I have cited several infrastructure safety issues that have been reported to JCI, B&B, and management. I have followed through to ensure the issues have been completed or to get a timeline for completion. I have informed station staff of these issues and what to look out for to ensure their safety.

I'm also their to assist, if needed, any redcap or baggage agents in order to maintain the dwell time of the train. This may require placing or removing bridge plates. Assisting with ADA passengers or assisting with the loading or unloading of baggage. I assist passengers by answering any questions or instruct passengers where to stand for the boarding process. Finally, I listen to the road channel once car doors have closed for departure to have an understanding of any delays that may take place and why. I then investigate delays and. if required, i dispute these delays with CTEC5 and also inform my supervisor.

If they do arrive into PHL station after a misconnect, I then weigh the difference between hoteling or taxing the passenger to their final destination.  

	I have offered Metro Lounge access to frustrated or irate passengers who they believe were not given professional or quality service due to late trains in order to maintain customer satisfaction. I have also offered one time only courtesy Metro Lounge access to customers who may have expired or excessive guest, again, to maintain customer satisfaction. 

	I have addressed employee performance complaints with coaching/guidance as needed and documented in TDRS, however, depending on the severity of failure, it may require discussion with my Assistant Superintendent.

 	I have reached out to TUCS pertaining to restroom, station, and exterior cleanliness. The placement of wet floor cones prior to inclement weather.

	I have ensured ushers monitor their boarding lines and check for any passengers with children or large bags requiring elevator rides for ease of boarding process. 

	I have required redcaps be at station entrances and or roaming the main floor to be visible for anyone require assistance

Goals:
	To have a more cohesive line of communication with upline and downline stations to help contact passengers who will possible misconnect to trains. This will help us avoid taxing or hoteling customers.

	I'm looking to hopefully have a representative from JCI or TUCKS occasionally attend team huddles or staff meetings so we can form a better understanding each others actions or duties which I'm hoping would elevate problems quicker.

	I looking to continue my relationship with our ARAMARK representative in order to continue to provide the refreshments and snacks offered to us and get a knowledge of any new items that will be offered.

	I would like to facilitate or be a part of a class which teaches or reinforces better customer service skill for our employees

	In an attempt to remain within the ticket office's financial goals, I blanked positions throughout the fiscal year that I knew would not impact the operation of the ticket office. However, due to staffing  issues and a lack of extra board agents, my department has justifiably been forced to utilize overtime to fill certain positions. As far as I am aware, we are at or below budget, however, we are still forced to use overtime until we can bolster our staff.

With the intent of encouraging other programs to follow our ADA lead.

 Understanding: The Team needs to understand what is required of them. This requires a ‘reachout’ to the Team members (the PM's, DoRs, Procurement Officers, Construction Managers, COTRs, FE, Assessment Teams, etc.) to make sure everyone’s on the same page. We’ve become somewhat large in size, with various members of each team doing what they need to do for their organization, that the ADA message isn’t at the forefront as it should be. That doesn’t mean the Team isn’t thinking of ADA, they are, but there are different goals amongst the various organizations within the department that should be a little closer inline with each other. Reassure they understand the efforts needed to produce the product we need to produce. And to assure everyone understands the final goal. This can be achieved by collaboration and working out situations efficiently and successfully.

Progress: Well, we have grown in personnel even more, so this task becomes far more pressing to achieve so everyone understands the ADA intent. Project Construction meetings have helped in for this task, but there is more to be done for me to reach a comfort level I’m expecting.

The intent is to assure they understand the value of involving the ADA Department in their project reviews and assuring they enforce the ADA Standards and requirements needed to make the project ADA Compliant.

There continue to be opportunities to improve the APT system. In my role as Tier 3 support of the BSR/BPC/APT system I often uncover and fix bugs, also find areas that need improvement and add data quality checks and alerts or add data areas to the dashboard. 

I also support downstream data quality in the CVR (State Reports).

I have continuously supported BSR/BPC/APT and continue to do so. 

Achievements:
1. I Improved the RRDW (Revenue and Ridership) import Process to include daily data anomaly reporting which included the APT and EDW team as well as upstream data providers flagging bad data going into APT and EDW. 
2. I continue to train Lead Developers on the use of source control and visual studio and isolated the development/QA/Prod environments from each other through the use of network tricks and system Environment variables and DNS Alias. 
3. Worked with the APT team to design a new method of mapping BI Train Legs by mapping station pairs <> Trains <> legs. This simplified the month end close process significantly saving time and improving accuracy of month end allocation reporting. 
4. I added several pages to the APT dashboard I developed, including BITrainStationapair, BITrainZeroEliminations (business rule when a BI train only runs one leg), MissingBiTrainStationPair (when a BI train hits a stationpair leg they have never hit before).
5. Cleaned out many superfluous tables and stored procedures from the BudgetForecast APT environment, these are either junk tables that were used by someone for debugging in the past, or fodder from previous renditions of the system or from when it was derived from the actuals environment. With many more to follow. 
6. Initiated the creation of a data dictionary to explain the many attributes of the master data which often are a mystery to the business and developers. This will be completed in the next FY.
7. Discovered the trip miles step in the Round 1 Stats package was disabled, worked with the business (Andre Bustamante and Herb Grey) to clean up the code in the stored procedure and modified the package to utilize the stored procedure by enabling the disabled step.
8. Identified a redundant dimension in the back end (mbrAPT_Unit) utilized by the system but invisible to the business, which is essentially a duplicate of mbrUnit which is visible to the business.

371900,"Successfully support the ART as a product owner.  This includes working with the business to obtain requirements, and then communicating those requirements to our streamaligned team so that user stories can be completed, tested, demonstrated, and deployed to the production environment.

My primary role as the product owner for Team Everest is to work closely with the multiple stakeholders to identify feature requirements, and then discuss these requirements with our team so that we can implement the necessary functionality into the Amtrak ecosystem.  Features come to Everest from our PM, as well as other business leaders within the ART.  During my interactions with stakeholders for features being worked Everest, as other ART members, I continued to expand my existing number of excellent working relationships within the organization.  

The features that Team Everest has worked on for the initial three program increments (PIs) include:

   Add Travel Insurance to Existing PNRs
   Payment Enhancements for Mobile App (Updates to Payment screen and AGR profile Payment Options)
   Travel Deliver Document ReWrite
   Apple Wallet Auto Update

A very important aspect, and significant portion of my time as PO, has been to impart institutional knowledge to team members who are new to Amtrak and the Amtrak ecosystem.  Given my previous experience working on DOTCOM and the mobile app, I have the knowledge that newer team members need to understand existing functionality and develop & test new pieces of functionality.  

Another significant aspect of my role as PO is to discuss software testing with our new testers.  This includes review of testing techniques, business scenarios, and providing test data.  These conversations were critical to ensure that our testers were developing and executing relevant, and necessary test cases.

During ARTlevel meetings, I am vocal, and respectful, in asking questions, and expressing my thoughts & ideas regarding the processes within the ART, and the operation of JIRA including the migration to the new cloud platform.  I am present for and fully participate in all ARTlevel meetings.   Since the beginning of the ART, I believe I have missed one ARTlevel meeting. 

During PI Planning events I have enabled conversation between the team members, as well as engaged in meaningful dialog with other teams so that features are fully understood, and teams can fully engage in their work.  During the PI2 and PI 3 I worked directly with the Legends of Loyalty team to understand the needs of that team and ensure that Everest could support Team LOL to implement their feature.

Team Everest deployed its first feature (Default Delay Alerts to On) during PI 2 as part of the mobile app release.   In PI 3, Everest deployed a fix related to enabling purchasing travel insurance with PayPal.

Team Everest has not accomplished the goals that we set so far.  However, it should be noted that the team has endured some significant challenges since January.  During the first PI, virtually our entire team was not present for the twoday project planning event.  This caused significant challenges as it hindered the ability of the overall team to understand what Everest was trying to accomplish, and it challenged our ability to come together as a team.  Also, our scrum master did not communicate well with the team and had to be replaced midPI. In addition, the composition of our team was such that we had too many developers for Arrow, and not enough for other channels.  

During PI 2, we had to remove our DOTCOM developer due to their inability to complete the necessary work, and we brought on a new developer.  This required further time for granting access to systems, providing knowledge transfer, incorporation them into the team dynamic, etc.",Completed,Active

368924,"Deliver my portion of jointly agreed goals with CapD PDPS: 

GOAL #1:  PROJECT PIPELINE ESTABLISHED:  Develop a list of projects Amtrak will be executing ranked by priority (priority factor to be determined by CapD) with full schedule of the procurements that will be needed for the life of the projects that is sufficient to enable Procurement to plan resources to support.  CapD and Procurement will jointly assess list to sort between CapD and nonCapD projects in order to determine which organization has the lead role that Procurement will engage with to meet the project procurement needs.  
 DUE DATE:  JAN 31 2023.

GOAL #2:  OIG AUDIT PREPARATION:  Develop standard template that must be used to document all contracting strategy decisions for CapD projects and the implementation plan for each strategy.
1.	Key elements to include are Project Description, Strategy Drivers for that Project, Strategy Selected, Why Selected, Costs/Benefits, Other Strategic Options Evaluated, Implementation Plan, etc
2.	Janice will draft the initial template and share with PDPS by JAN 15  2023  COMPLETED.
3.	Teams must collaborate on threshold for this documentation, $25M+ contracts?  For all that have a PDM completed? All contracts?
4.	End goal is to ensure sufficient documentation in place 1) in the event of an OIG audit and 2) to ensure strategies selected can be implemented.

GOAL #3:  STIPEND USAGE DOCUMENTATION: develop standard template that documents the business case for offering stipends on any CapD project that requests the use of a stipend as part of the RFx process.

BACKGROUND ON THIS GOAL FOR KUVESH:  I developed these goals and gained concurrence on them from CAPD early in FY23.  None of these goals can/could be achieved unless PDPS completed their side of what they agreed to do.  My update verbage will reflect this fact.

UPDATE AUG 18:
For Item #1:  The goal to establish as prioritized pipeline of projects was agreed to be the responsibility of PDPS.  It was not delivered by Jan 31 as promised.  It really has never materialized, in my view.   As a result, Procurement did not have a chance to work out Procurement schedules and plan our resourcing well. Instead, priority projects ended up being those that happened to have the eye of PDPS staff  this is how BPT, CRB, etc took center stage when CAPD ramped up.  As a result, we attack procurement for many (large) projects all at once which drove procurement to stretch it resources and create some tight procurement schedules.  In good Projects organizations, a PDPS team should establish the criteria for prioritizing projects.  And then applies that criteria to the funnel of projects to establish which goes first and where resources should spend their time/effort.  For example, some great criteria that could have been applied are: funding secured, critical customer need, critical  technical need, etc.

GOAL #2:  I completed my part of this goal which was to establish a strategy summary template document.  The reason I asked that PDPS agree to this goal, frankly, was to prepare for an OIG audit on a potential ~$250M Delivery Partner contract for BPT.  Reason I wanted to be prepared for an OIG audit is because when I asked for the strategy summary, business case justification, pros/cons of awarding such a contract, the explanation given by PDPS (TRyan) was totally insufficient.  I wanted to have documentation by the end user of the contract on why/how they directed Procurement to go to market for this type contract.  I still believe such a document should be completed and part of the procurement documents of record as it spells out to the OIG why procurement is doing what we are doing.

By fostering strong partnerships with departments such as Mechanical, Engineering, and Station groups, we achieved a successful audit year marked by collaboration and effective teamwork. External audits conducted by regulatory agencies in Sanford and Hialeah were equally successful, resulting in inspections that yielded no Notice of Violations or Notice of NonCompliance findings. This accomplishment underscores our unwavering commitment to adherence and compliance.
Furthermore, my efforts to reduce energy consumption at the New Orleans facility, in collaboration with the Engineering and Mechanical groups, have yielded substantial results. By working closely on annual energy plan goals, we have successfully decreased energy consumption and positively impacted both our environmental footprint and operational costs. In addition, working in tandem with the Sanford and Hialeah facilities, our focus on improving recycling diversion rates has proved fruitful. This collective effort has significantly lowered the amount of waste directed to landfills, thereby reducing waste costs and contributing to a more sustainable approach to waste management.
These achievements highlight my dedication to driving positive change, fostering collaboration, and ensuring the highest standards are met across all facets of our operations.

Created an example of a tracking report for the mangers to use for a particular route or train number. This will help the manager track the progress of the conversations about the behavior of the employee. (See attached) 

The second presentation was to the team of Dequincy Mcrae, Director of Ops Compliance. It consisted of several Lead Ops Compliance Officers throughout the system.  We reviewed the reports to understand and have knowledge of the reports. It will help the Compliance Officers to work with the local Train Managers to identify and correct inconsistent behavior with employees. 

The third presentation was with two of the Food & Beverage Ops Specialists, Charles Boney (NYP) and Thomas Townsend (WAS).  We reviewed 8 of the 14 reports.

This report is part of the WIMS RTS process. It will help the F&B Managers to work on Aramark’s inconsistent behavior to determine at which stage of the process an inventory discrepancy may have occurred.

The fourth presentation was with Marsha Reid and Floneva Moore from the Service and Standards Group. The purpose of this presentation is to share my knowledge and demonstrate how the reports can be used for auditing purposes.

The AVSRS is an excellent system to report, track and solve safety centric issues. Through the use of this system, a higher level of accountability exists and feedback to reporting personnel is built in. This helps to keep a two way line of communication and therefore inspire trust and an esprit de corps. I have been working toward the acceptance of this system by the entire AMT staff of the MARC Penn Line.

375846,"BSP Process for Boston Shop Tier 1

Before your shift starts, the Foreman calls the Yardmaster and asks what can be “flagged in” (apply BSP).

Yardmaster will verbally confirm if he is done making “moves” (repositioning equipment). If not done making moves, Yardmaster will state what tracks these moves are being made on. Yardmaster will state which tracks moves are not being made on so the Foreman can flag in. After moves are done being made, Yardmaster will call Foreman and let the Foreman know moves are done and that the tracks are ready to be flagged in. 

Foreman has a signin sheet during preshift safety briefing. Don’t forget to sign the signin sheet. The signin sheet is a tool used to be able to account for: total of workers that came into work today and who is here for each craft. If you are late to work, you must see the Foreman before starting work and sign the signin sheet. 

Foreman distributes the work to each employee / craft

Foreman directs worker where equipment is (what track, inside or outside of building).

Foreman states whether it can be flagged in (applies BSP) or if there is going to be movement on track before starting work

Foreman will direct the Laborer to flag in (applies BSP) equipment. If work is inside the shop, the derails closest to the shop will be applied on the track where work is being done. If work is being done outside the shop building the derail closest to shop building will be applied on the track where work is being done. This is to protect the workers inside the shop and the switch on same track will be thrown (positioned away) from where the work is being done and locked with the supplied lock. After this is complete laborer will: chock wheels and apply lights and flags in each cab of the locomotives/controlling cars on the track being worked on. Laborer will tell Foreman the track is flagged in, then Foreman will tell worker “Safe to go to work”. Worker will check to make sure it is flagged in properly before performing work.

If worker needs to get on, under, between or into a machine room in another locomotive to reference something, please let the Foreman know, so Foreman can call the Yardmaster and get permission to flag in the track. Once the track is flagged in Foreman will let the worker know it is safe to work on this equipment.

When you are done working notify a Foreman; Foreman will direct laborer to unflag track (drop or remove BSP), Foreman then calls Yardmaster and confirms “mechanical release” to Yardmaster. This means that full control of the tracks is given back to the Yardmaster.",On Track,Active

Work with local Ivy City HSR Facilities Manager (Jorge Angulo) to find a an applicable set of vacuum pumping system.  Performed investigations of various vacuum pump manufacturers technologies and the required due diligence.  A new system was was selected, Rotary Lobe type pumps by Vogelsang, will eliminate the need of holding tanks and their needed controls to operate.  The tanks and controls are a cause of failures and high maintenance. 
 The new pumps will dump direct to the sanitary sewer line.  
The pumps can be maintained in line.  No need to be taken out of the assembly.
The new vacuum system arrangement will minimize the need current frequent Maintenance, by simply removing the pump cover and replacing the seals in place and clean the pump, simplify monitoring without the need of elaborate control sensors and tanks. System currently needs to shut down and clean tanks and controls. The new technology is used for the Vacuum System upgrades in Southampton, SSY, and LA Yard.  Finally it was shared with the PMs for the proposed Airo Facilities.

Bear DE; Automation of Decal Removal from the Coaches 

Currently in order to remove the Decals from the side of the coaches; the process requires two employees for two days of labor.  The process is dusty with a lot of biproduct generation which requires filtering and labor intensive cleaning.  
Worked with the local Mechanical Supervisor (Ed Dennis) to test laser Decal removal systems that are used in the airline industry.  Samples from the coaches with various types of Decals were sent to laser manufacturers for evaluation and validation of the removal capabilities. The company with the most robust removal abilities for all the types and age of decals was Lasertronics.  Were able to provide a completely clean and steel surface with on need for surface preparation to attach a new Decal.  The process can be fully automated with laser arms on either side of the Coach.  Minimum biproduct and no cleaning required.  The removal process will be able to be reduced to less than 8 hours and about of an hour and half of man hours for set up and cleaning.  The ROI of the install installation cost is about 5.5 Years.  See attached report.

Important fact:  this system is used by the warehouse Managers and their support team when needing to process Vendor invoices for payment.   It is equally important to know that if the system remains down for several days or a number of hours, it has the potential to prevent the LSA (onboard community) from selling liquor products onboard the trains, which is one of our major sellers.  
Historical Info:  if Amtrak does not pay our liquor vendors ""upon receipt"", the vendors will put a HOLD on Amtrak's account, meaning ""no paymentno deliveries"".   This also applies to some food vendors.)

	I have completed numerous actions and documented it in my Managers Activity Report. Most have been to recognize staff accomplishments for their outstanding service towards our customers; their continuation of their adhering to Amtrak's uniform and grooming standards; and mostly, their outstanding performance of their efforts towards situational awareness, which I promote in every team huddle and document in TDRS. Because our stations customer service staff is the face of Amtrak, they play a huge part in impacting our Durmmac scoes. 

	I conduct a station walkabout every day to identify any station infrastructure problems which needs to be addressed and report said issues to the appropriate department for correction or repair. 

	PHL Station exterior, entrances and exits have been kept in a clean and working condition to better assist ADA, VIP, and standard customers. Ticket area, counters and the ADA ticket booth have maintained a level of cleanliness and operational to assist ADA passengers. 

	Because of my actions, we have achieved high marks in our Metro Lounge, which is in part due to the project I worked on to bring the Vivreau Tap system and new refrigeration unit into the lounge. Also, I worked with Aramark to raise the level of snacks and beverages provided within the Metro Lounge. Furthermore, the hand picked Metro Lounge agents have consistently received compliments and commendations for their exemplary customer service. 

	Due to my working relationship with station cleaning staff, TUCS, I have attempted to maintain a clean, working, and welcoming restroom environment for Amtrak customers. I have often received compliments from customers in regards to the cleanliness of our restrooms and the friendly JCI staff manning them. 

	Platforms have consistently been clean and safe; station agents demeanor have been welcoming and professional, grooming and uniforms have been adhered to as per Amtrak standards, and I have assisted with, and made sure our boarding process was easy, pleasant, and safe for our customers.

Goal: To maintain the consistent level of excellence our station has achieved and to hopefully learn from other stations, and they from us, in order to help increase on total scores.
