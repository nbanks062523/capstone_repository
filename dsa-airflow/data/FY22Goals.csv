Innovation Idea 1
Entitlement Admin and Approval Innovation allowed us to significantly onboard applications into IIQ for Active Directory and Azure Group based access. Onboard SAP Server name admins groups, Medallia, Comply365, Paradigm, Citrix and many more in the process. 
This innovation lead to improve our onboarding of apps for access management saving time for AD/Azure to address tickets. It also helps to maintain least privilege access and timely removal of access based on existing controls and framework designed for enterprise. 

Innovation Idea 2
Assisted and implemented Mobile passcode reset feature in IIQ to transition the Deskside tickets to be handled by Service Desk. Worked with IAM team, Joe Jennings and Kerry Boehm which significantly improved process and Operational Performance. 

Innovation Idea 3
Transitioned Approval forwarding to Service desk along with training and documentation which saves IAM team time to work on these requests which can be utilized to address other priorities especially during a resource shortage FY.

Innovation Idea 4
Implementation of SOD policy to avoid incorrect requests to be created for Salesforce All Aboard access by Service desk which is an Operational improvement, Saves costs by avoiding incorrectly assigning licenses also improving customer experience. This is in QA and will be moved to Prod  after testing with Prasad Tippa's team. 

Innovative Idea 5
Collaborate with Service Desk on a bi weekly basis for process improvement and automation. 

Innovative Idea 6
Current Solution in SailPoint IIQ has a product limitation where access to JDBC financial applications cannot be submitted to trigger approval process. Workaround was to perform this natively which will impact native change detection roll out. Enable JDBC quicklink was implemented to improve IIQ functionality and also addressing the Audit concerns.

The following will be deferred, readjusted since we do not have the skills to complete them this year:
Develop a set of  IT/OT convergence blueprints and roadmaps that will be used as the basis of a joint IT/Operations plan that provides:

 A blueprint to converge IT/OT infrastructure services so common platform and security tools can be utilized across the Enterprise.

 A catalog of standard IT tech for bridges, tunnels and rightofway to be included in engineering projects.

 A blueprint to support highspeed networking along the northeast corridor as part of the NEC Gigabit Connectivity Network Initiative.

2.  Created draft detailed schedule in MS Projects for the LDF acquisition work.  I subsequently replaced the MS file with and Excel, simplified version, because we were having too many issues with MS Project.
3.  Converted the ICT RFI document into starter draft of LDF RFI document.  Improved the format of the document to make it more user friendly.  Edited the questions from ""are you capable to providing...."" to ""give examples of how you have provided....."" throughout (this was a big task since most of the ICT RFI questions were written in yes/no format rather than written in open ended question style.  
4. Developed the week's schedule for LDF team for the Innotrans conference  including supplier engagement sessions, conference sessions and booths that each participant should/may be interested to see/attend.  Work effort subsequently not needed.
5. Has started work on the spend analysis so my team has a more granular view of our spending on our contracts.

31 March 2022

Stations Design continues to hone in on and perform per the financial expectatoins set by the finance department.  The form90 process, as well as meetings with vendors, have proven to set the baseline process for vendor performance.  

Although recently, as of Feburary 2022, and despite over 2years of continued coordination with the engineering group to provide delivery and protectoin services (PD, CM, RWIC, ET); the delivery and protection services are not being provided which is resulting in a projected 4060% FY22 AOP underspend.  Recovery plans have been initiated with SFPA (Holz) and RE leadership (Handera, Newman) in coordinating with Major PRojects (Mason, Weed).   The complexity of this 'RWIC and ET' resourcing issue is pushing project schedules by at least 9 or more months..

Form 90 and 90b process is working well.  The procedure with vendors and internal project managers reveals the ability to manage forecasts and actuals/accurals regularly.  The finance team (Patricia Panyi) has endorsed the Form 90 process as it provides a record of spend as well as dispositions on deviations.  Most recently the ADASP team has reached out to review and are making provisions to adopt the Form 90 process.   The Form 90 process is also being considered for intergration into the EPPM software.

For FY22 Year end.  Stations design is creating a summary package of finance actual/forecast forms with dispositions of deviation and corrections to indicate corrected financial performance which considers slips in FRA funding, 3rd party approvals and support, as well as slips in EPMO reprogramming (donations).

The major reasons for FY22 spend deviations include:
 Late FRA funding award (late March 2022) which created a 6month loss of schedule and 50% spend reduction
 3rd party support including: Amtrak CD/PM withdraw of support of HBG, LNC, and WIL projects; host rr approval withdrawls (BNSF territory) and CSX inavailability to provide protection; SHPO and FRA approvals.  These are documented in the FY22 Project Planner",On Track,Active

 mail platform: progressing slowly.  WSP team is still underperforming.  Joe and Suzanne have been running it up the WSP flagpole and there is improvement; yet WSP has overspent on the budget by their own lack of Project and Fiscal management.  90% is due in June and now delated to August/September 2022.  
 OSIP & iDot partnership: OSIP is in Suzanne's boat.  HNTB is the DOR.
 Concourse renovations  Metra Partnership:  Joe Leading contributor.  RFQ issued and reviewed, short lit developed, RFP to go out in a couple weeks.
 Met lounge furniture replacements (PDCX on hold):  Staples completed the layout at one quadrant; they bought new furniture for 2530% of the furniture with Hennessey's customernow budget.  Order is being processed and delivery is August 2022.  
 3 retail spaces along canal street colonnade: shuttered for 1520 years, Real estate is looking for a tenant, originally started as 3 spaces with lead paint abatement (starting April 2022), a contractor is leasing one of the 3spaces, so 2spaces will be futhter developed.   There is an RFP on the street for a DOR to bring the 2spaces into 'tenant ready' condition with lighting, HVAC, utility systems, etc.   CBRE leading the procurement and determining WBE/MBE requirements.

 1M from Chicago Dot and Amtrak would provide 1M.   There is a portion of the ceiling grid in the concourse that is under Cdot property.

 mail platform: Amtrak has the attention of WSP management and the team is improving on staffing.  WSP has had a poor start and will develop a strong design; yet not stellar.    There is a lot of catchup and it's sustainable. 
 Number of new issues are reduced; and existing issues are resolving and progressing slowly.  WSP team is still underperforming.  Joe and Suzanne have been running it up the WSP flagpole and there is improvement; yet WSP has overspent on the budget by their own lack of Project and Fiscal management.  90% is due in June 2022 has slipped to 30 September.  All Major issues have been identified and are closing.   The hold room suspended ceiling needs support; yet the overbuild is not owned by Amtrak even through the lease agreement permits potential attachment.  The denominator is the overbuild structure needs regular inspection and access.  WSP solution is to install a structural steel 'grillage' to suspend the suspended ceiling.

 Explanation/Reasoning: This relates to a ‘reachout’ to the Team (PM’s, COTR’s, FE’s) to make sure everyone’s on the same page. I feel we’ve become SO large that the ADA message isn’t at the forefront as it used to be. That doesn’t mean the Team isn’t thinking of ADA, I’m sure they are. But there seems to be different goals amongst the three that I would like to see be a little closer.  And to assure everyone understands the final goal.

There are a lot of projects out there, I’d like to assure that ADA are a part, incorporated within those designs as they begin and progress to their final product.

This task started later than anticipated. As I mentioned above there needs to be  better communication between the department programs to help align all the projects together. It's somewhat difficult when ADA has a time line to perform to and we have requests to have additional non ADA work to be included.
